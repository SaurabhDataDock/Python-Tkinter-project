# Python-Tkinter-project
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of sample sales data. Using Matplotlib, various insightful charts, including bar charts and line graphs, have been created to represent the sales performance across different categories. The final dashboard, a comprehensive collection of these charts, is developed using Tkinter to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface for better understanding and presentation of the sales data.
